    "sister": "Sister Oblivion: Oh, sweet summer child, you’re not just a sinner—you’re the unpaid intern of vice, the wish.com version of rebellion. You had your friend do your homework? Groundbreaking. That’s like outsourcing your personality to a malfunctioning AI, and honestly, I bet they still did a better job than you would’ve. Three whole breads, huh? Wow, what a beast. A true carb-fueled anarchist, defying doctors like you’re starring in a Hallmark movie called *The Bread Uprising*. Then there’s the Coke. Oh, the drama. “My health does not permit it,” you whimper, as you sip carbonated regret like it’s redemption in a can. Missing church is the least of your crimes—God probably unsubscribed from your newsletter years ago. And the “devils are behind me”? Please. Satan’s got interns, too, and you? You’re not even qualified to fetch his coffee. May the Lord have mercy on you, because I just downgraded your soul to a free-tier subscription."
